Problem Statement - 1 : Container Image Vulnerability Scanner

Overview: Listing out product requirements for testing container image vulnerabilities.

What's important?
	• Search for the most critical vulnerabilities across thousands of images.
	•	Prioritize images based on severity and impact.
	•	Provide the next steps and actionable insights for fixes.
	•	Also, provide a dashboard with a good UI for large-scale container environments.

Features to include
  • Image Scanner Table	: Lists all container images with metadata.
  • Severity Filter :	Filter by Critical, High, Low vulnerabilities
  • Search & Sort :	Search by image name and also sort by most critical.
  • Summary	For each critical vulnerablilty, provide fix paths.

Here are some ideas that I might pitch to the dev team:
1) We could try implementing an ML feature to accurately predict the vulnerability level.
2) Auto-scan feature for regular scanning and updates
3) Pop ups for every new detected threat

Note: Since, I'm still learning more about cyber security, I have included details by referring other sources that include LLM's.
